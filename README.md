# Nimble2eDataEntry
Just a place to dump Foundry item exports (the item.JSON files) since Discord won't allow me to upload them there.

## The CSV files
These are spreadsheet exports because I don't want to manage this side of it. Someone else can import those to a spreadsheet and it will save them the effort of typing in all the monster, boon and spell names.

## The JSON files - import to Foundry
If you want to import any into Foundry, first create an item of that type. Then  right-click the item and "import data". Select the JSON file and it will overwrite the blank item you've created.

## The JSON files - export from Foundry
Create the item, right click it and choose "export data". Don't change the save-as name.
